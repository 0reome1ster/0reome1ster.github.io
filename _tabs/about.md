This blog exists as a repository of information and knowledge I've learned in the security realm; mostly related to low-level programming and exploitation. During my time in university I've had the opportunity of competing in various cybersecurity competitions - lots of blue/red/purple teaming competitions and CTFs. I found myself enjoying the offensive side of cybersecurity, especially in writing custom exploits and tooling.

Some of my security-related interests:
- Malware Development - Bootkits, Kernel Rootkits, etc.
- Vulnerabilitiy Research / Binary Exploitation / Reverse Engineering
- PoC-ing out 0days and n-days
- Cryptography
- CTFs
